Premise
Chicago has both a crime and budgetary problem.  We plan to examine how socioeconomic factors such as banking deserts and quality of education affect crime in the city, in order to advise on realistic solutions within a realistic budgetary scope.
Research Questions
What is the relationship between socioeconomic factors such as income with violent crime in the last five years?
What effect does the city’s allocation of resources to neighborhoods have on crime?
